## WHY THIS REPOSITORY ? 

most new applications or discoveries in this field end up enriching some big companies, leaving behind small businesses or simple projects. One striking example of this is Autogpt, an autonomous AI agent capable of performing tasks.

Autogpt and similar projects like BabyAGI **only work with paid APIs, which is not fair**. That's why I tried to recreate a simpler but very interesting and, above all, open-source version of Autogpt that **does not require any API and does not need any particular hardware.**

I believe that by providing free and open-source AI tools, we can give small businesses and individuals the opportunity to create new and innovative projects without the need for significant financial investment.
